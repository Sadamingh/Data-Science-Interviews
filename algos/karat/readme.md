- Given a value and looply divide by 10 for the digits. What is the complexity of this method?

- Given two functions of snapshot, one is nlogm and the other is m + n, which one is more efficient?

- If you want to design a function randomly output a sentence of a textfile, can we change the file to bytes, then randomly pick a bytes and then find the newlines before and behind this bytes (parse). The output is the sentence between these two lines. Is that going to work?

No because the length of lines are not the same so not random enough.

- If you want to design a function randomly output a file under a user, can we get all the file size, then randomly choose a byte and find one file with this size?
